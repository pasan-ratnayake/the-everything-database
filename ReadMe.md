# Welcome to the Everything Database

As developers, we write so many tools and scripts. To top it off, we search the same thing over and over again. I remember the frustration of not being able to find what I want as well. So this is an attempt (fully knowing that it too will get outdated) to catalog some of those to avoid the frustration and may be help some of you. If you have any **generic** useful scripts, your PR is welcome.

Hope this helps.

## Scripts

- [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/)
  - [Basic V2 Template](Scripts/AutoHotKey/Basic%20V2%20Template.ahk) : A starting template for a AHK V2 script.
  - [Spam Left Click](Scripts/AutoHotKey/Spam%20Left%20Click.ahk) : Send multiple left clicks with a shortcut.
  - [Run Scripts In Folder](Scripts/AutoHotKey/Run%20Scripts%20In%20Folder.ahk) : Searches for .ahk files in folders and run them.
