# Welcome to the Everything Database

As developers, we write so many tools and scripts. To top it off, we search the same thing over and over again. I remember the frustration of not being able to find what I want as well. So this is an attempt (fully knowing that it too will get outdated) to catalog some of those to avoid the frustration and may be help some of you. If you have any **generic** useful scripts, your PR is welcome.

Hope this helps.
